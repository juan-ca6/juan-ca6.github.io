											<h2>AI-Generated Art</h2>

											<p>Data science is usually related to new technologies, computers and statistics, but it is also related to <strong>art</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>.
											For example, let's look at some of the most famous artificial intelligences. <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2">Dalle-2</a> and <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/">Midjourney</a>. </p>
											<p>This type of programs allow anyone to create images, paintings, cartoons and graphic designs with just a single "prompt and click". It gives the chance to explore the limitations of AI art, creation of digital art, etc.
											But with these great achievements come greater dilemmas. What about human art? Should there be content regulation? What are the ethical implications of creating with an AI?</p>

											<h3>The Dilemma</h3>
											<p>The use of AI has saprked a debate all over the world, so now let's talk about some of the pros and cons about it.
											First of all, one of the greatest advantages of AI-generated art is the ability to democratize art.
											Nowadays, anyone can go to a internet platform and use public tools to create their own artwork.
											No matter how skilled you are, or how involved you are in the art community, you can have access to programs that make your art come alive.
											This may inspire people to come around artistic media and participate.
											</p>
											
											<p>Another pro is that AI-generated art is really inclusive! Anyone who is visually impared or has difficulties with convencional art mediums can experiment with art.
											This transforms into a more accesible media, leads to a new experimentation of art and pushes the boundaries that were set before.
											</p>

											<p>In contrast, one of the main cons of AI-generated art is the question of authenticity and ownership.
											Now we don't know if the pictures we are looking at were created by a human made algorithm or by a real person.
											This brings to attention the problem of giving credit to the correct artist.
											Also, it is important to say that most of the AI promgrams are trained with human made art. Mostly without the consent of their creators, so we have to establish certain regulations on it.
											</p>
											
											<p> Finally, another con is the problem with content generation and privacy.
											I'm a firm believer of Optimistic Anthropology, but I also know that there are people that want/will generate certain (harmful) content.
											(Content that is violent or NSFW related, for example).
											It all comes to regulation, again. We've all seen Pope Francis puffer jacket photo, which was generated by a Midjourney user.
											What if instead of Pope Francis it was you? Not so cool, probably you'd feel that your privacy has been invaded.
											And worse off, what if the image generated made you look as if you were committing a crime or doing something illegal? 
											Danger! That is why we should take a step and make AI-generated art safe, but keep it as free as we can.
											</p>
											
											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
											<p> Overall, AI has allowed and empowered people to create art in a new way. It comes with great opportunities and tools, so we have to take the chance and use it.
											But, we should: regulate the content that can be generated, protect the privacy of all individuals and lastly, ensure that the artists get credit and ownership over their art.
											</p>
